HOW TO USE
1. Automatically load from textfile
2. use option to follow!


HW11 - Contact

We are implementing a contact application with following operations:

load, save, insert, delete, retrieve, sort, print (you can implement them as member functions of class)

load: load a file into a data structure
save: save the contact data into a file
insert: add a new person
delete: delete a person from the data (given a person's name, search the person and delete it) (assume that name is a unique key)
retrieve: search a person by name or email (please implement both), and print out the personâ€™s info.
sort: you can sort the contacts by name or by birthday (implement both)
print: print out all contacts
Each line of a file (for 'load' and 'save') is in the following format.

name; birthday; email; phone_number
ex) henry choi; 20190303; hchoi@handong.edu; 010-1234-5678
When you save the array into a file, please follow the same format.

If you want, you can reuse your implementation for the previous homework assignment.
